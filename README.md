## Eurorack Pedals

Collection of Guitar and Bass Pedal pcbs designed to fit the Eurorack format.
designed with the free version of [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1).

The Eurorack specifications followed are:

- Height 3U 
- Width>10HP.  

The width spec ensures that there is enough space between the footswitch of subsequent modules.

The power does not follow the Eurorack format since most analog pedals need a 9V input.

To connect a chain of pedals to classic Eurorack modules, the signal needs to be amplified.

### Licence

The designs are free to use non-commercially.

I would not recommend using commercially since 
copyrights may apply to the schematics / fonts etc.

### Resources 

I'd like to thank all the people offering to the DIY community and link some resources that helped me get familiar with designing pcb's.

Jeremy Blum's [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sciguy14) has some good tutorials for EAGLE basics.

Effect's Layout [blog](http://effectslayouts.blogspot.com/) / [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuCJhqsyaGveg0PjLbAGcdQ) has a big variety of pedal designs for perfboards / pcb etching. Also a nice tutorial series for EAGLE and a pack of EAGLE libraries with focus to pcb design for pedals. 

[MadBeanPedals](https://www.madbeanpedals.com/) has some designs and tutorials for homemade pcb etching. He also has a very helpful EAGLE library.
